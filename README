  templates/          - templates for new scripts/config files with the API module

SCRIPTS
These should all have -h/--help options (totally overengineered in this regard) and (might) do what they sound like.

  COMMON SATELLITE TASKS:
*   clone-channel.py
*   create-channel.py
*   delete-channel.py
*   delete-kickstart.py
*   list-channels.py
*   list-keys.py
*   rhnsession.py
*   upload-config-file.py
*   upload-snippet.py

  JSON DUMP/RESTORE
*   json2kickstart.py      - dumps kickstart profiles to JSON format
*   kickstart2json.py      - imports a JSON dump to a satellite.
*                            Allows you to choose which kickstarts to import from the JSON file.
* 
*   ksoutput.txt           - pretty-printed output example.
* 
*   configchannel2json.py  - dumps a config channel (or a list of them) to JSON format
*   json2configchannel.py  - unfinished restore script. I'll get there.

CONFIG FILE
  I'd create a ~/.rhninfo file if I were you (you'll be prompted for user info anyway, but it simplifies things)
  password/login as None essentially means 'prompt'
  see templates/rhninfo.template, but it looks like this:

[DEFAULT]
login=None
password=None

[your.sat.server]
login=xxxxxx
password=None
