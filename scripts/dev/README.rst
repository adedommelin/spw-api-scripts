README for scripts/dev
======================

Scripts in this directory are under development and may contain half-formed ideas or experiments.

They're included in git tracking just in case anything in there is useful in the future.

They are not packaged by default when using the distutils build process.

Once a script is deemed 'ready', it's promoted out of the dev directory in the main scripts dir.
